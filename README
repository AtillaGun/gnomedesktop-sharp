With this code, you can generate updated mono bindings for 
libgnome-desktop 2. It's based on the gnome-desktop-sharp project. It's 
useful for mono apps that want to get rid of the 
deprecated gnome-sharp dependency, and use the new 
DesktopThumbnailFactory API proivded by recent libgnome-desktop 
releases.

To generate the C# source, simply run the ./generate.sh command.
